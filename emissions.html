									Climate change continues to be one of the largest looming threats we face in society. 
									There are a myriad contributing factors as well as various potential solutions.

									CO2 emissions are one of the leading causes of the acceleration of climate
									change, so it may be prescient to understand how our daily habits relate to these emissions, 
									so that we can aim for solutions towards a more sustainable tomorrow.

								</div>



								<div style="margin-top: 20px;">
									In this project, we will be working with a vehicle dataset containing 16 vehicle classes (ex: sedan), 
									42 makes (ex: Honda), and over 2,000 different models (ex: Accord).
									This dataset contains data such as characteristics of a vehicle (size, number of cylinders, etc.) 
									and its level of emissions.

								</div>

								<div style="margin-top: 20px;">
									Our first objective is to conduct an exploratory data analysis so we can better understand our data and 
									also identify interesting trends and statistics about these classes, makes, and models.
								</div>

								<div style="margin-top: 20px;">
									Next, we want to identify which features of a vehicle correlate most strongly with its CO2 emissions. 
									This will show us which features we can then run a linear regression model on, to see how well we're able to 
									predict a vehicle's emissions.
									
								</div>
								<div style="margin-top: 20px;">
									We'll use Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and other libraries to help us accomplish this.
								</div>
							</div>
						</div>

						<div>
							<div>
								Here's a quick look at what the data's format looks like:
							</div>
							<img class="image fit" src="images/project1/emissions-head.png" alt="" width="90%"/>
						</div>

						<div className="" style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; justify-content:space-between;">
							<div> 
								<div>
									After getting a brief look at the data by using various Pandas methods 
									(such as .head, .describe, etc.), we conducted an exploratory data analysis
									to do a deeper dive into the data. 
								
								</div>

								<!-- <br/> -->
								<div style="margin-top: 20px;"> 
									One of the first questions we wanted to answer was: which vehicle makes perform the best and the worst in
									terms of CO2 emissions? This chart below helps us answer that. We see that Smart, Honda, and Fiat
									are the best performers; and Bugatti, Lamborghini, and SRT are the worst.
								</div>
							</div>
							<div>
								<img class="image fit" src="images/project1/make-emissions.png"  />
							</div>
						</div>

						<div className="" style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; justify-content:space-between;">
							<div> 
								<div style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
									Next, we'll get a more detailed look at this same comparison by looking at the 
									box plots for each vehicle make. This lets us take a look at the median emissions for 
									each vehicle make as well as its interquartile range (IQR). And then we can 
									compare that to the sample median of CO2 emissions across all vehicles 
									(represented by the red dotted line.)

									<i> (To see further explanations for the boxplots and the IQR, see the Jupyter notebook 
									<a
								href="https://github.com/benwho19/carbon-emissions/blob/main/CO2-Linear-Regression.ipynb"
							target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> here </a>.)

							</div>
						</div>

						<div className="" style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; justify-content:space-between;">
							<div> 
								<div>
									Next, we explored other features such as a vehicle's fuel consumption in the city
									vs. on the highway (bottom-left chart) and the number of cylinders in a vehicle (bottom-right chart).

								</div>

								<div style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px;">
									We see that fuel consumption is higher in the city, and that the most common
									number of cylinders in a vehicle are 4 and 6.
								</div>

								<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; align-items: center;">
									<div>
										<img src="images/project1/fuel-consumption.png" width="350px" height="350px"/>

						</div>
						<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; justify-content: space-between;">
							<div>
								<div>
									After finishing the EDA, we then wanted to build a linear regression model to make predictions
									on a vehicle's CO2 emissions based on its other features. First,
									we looked for relationships between the features of our data.
								</div>

								<div style="margin-top: 20px;">
									In the bottom-left chart, we have a heatmap
									of the correlations between our different vehicle features. We see that
									CO2 emissions are most strongly correlated with engine size and fuel consumption.
								</div>

								<div style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 15px;">
									And in the bottom-right chart, we have a scatter plot to show the relationship between
									each vehicle's engine size and its CO2 emissions, 
									with a best-fit line drawn. Engine size will be the first feature we will use to make our
									predictions.
								</div>
							</div>
							<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between;">
								<div style="width: 45%;">
									<img src="images/project1/heatmap.png" width="350px" height="350px"/>
								</div>
								<div style="width: 40%;">
									<img src="images/project1/engine-size-scatter.png" width="350px" height="350px"/>
								</div>

							</div>	
						</div>

						<div>
							<div style="margin-top: 20px;">
								We first
								split our data into a training set and test set.
								After training our model on the training set,
								we make our test predictions and then evaluate the model's performance.
							</div>

							<div style="margin-top: 20px;">
								Our simple linear regression model achieved a 64% accuracy in predicting a vehicle's CO2 emissions
								from its engine size. 
								<ul>
									<li> R2 score: 0.64 </li>
									<li> Mean absolute error: 22.69 </li>
									<li> Mean squared error: 895.56 </li>
									<li> Root mean squared error: 29.93 </li>
								</ul>

								We could do better. So we then run a multiple linear regression model, which now additionally uses a vehicle's number of
								cylinders and combined fuel consumption to predict its emissions, and we are able to achieve an 86%
								accuracy.
								<ul>
									<li> R2 score: 0.86 </li>
									<li> Mean absolute error: 13.15 </li>
									<li> Mean squared error: 421.15 </li>
									<li> Root mean squared error: 20.52 </li>
								</ul>

								We see that our R2 score is higher and our MAE, MSE, and RMSE are all lower.
								<i> (The R2 score tells us how well our model performs. It has a maximum value of 1.0 and we want it to be as high as possible.
									The MAE, MSE, and RMSE all measure the amount of error from our model, so a lower number is better for
									these three.
									To see further explanations for these metrics, see the Jupyter notebook that is linked below.)</i>
