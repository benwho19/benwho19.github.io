									Hi, I'm Ben. I enjoy working with large, messy datasets to uncover actionable insights from them.
									
									<!-- The challenge of solving a difficult problem as well as the camaraderie of collaborating
									effectively with others are what ultimately bring me satisfaction
									when it comes to work. -->

									I love the lightbulb-moment feeling of connecting the dots and the satisfaction of solving tough technical problems. 
								</p>
								<p>
									A little about me: I live in the Bay Area and was born and raised in San Francisco. In my spare
									time, I enjoy staying active, spending time with friends and family,
									and watching TV
									shows (some of my favorite shows are Arcane, House of the Dragon, and 
									For All Mankind.)

								</p>

									<p>
										I graduated from UC Berkeley with a degree in Cognitive Science, and 
										during my time there, I was introduced to topics like computer science and
										data science. It was in these courses that I first tackled interesting projects such as
										determining the relationship between U.S. states' crime rates and capital punishment laws.
										<!-- <br/> -->
									</p>

									<p>
										Afterwards, I found work as a software engineer - but after about a year, I realized that a data role
										might be better suited for me
										and I decided to make the switch. Many of the same things that attracted me to
										software engineering also attract me to data analysis, such as brainstorming creative solutions and utilizing
										code to solve real-world problems.
										
									</p>
									<p>
										I'm excited for what the future holds and can't wait to dive in. 
									</p>
