									Hi, I'm Ben. I enjoy quantitative problem-solving, especially when
									it involves writing code and working with large datasets.
									
									The challenge of solving a difficult problem as well as the camaraderie of collaborating
									effectively with others are what ultimately bring me satisfaction
									when it comes to work.
								</p>
								<p>
									A little about me: I live in the Bay Area and was born and raised in San Francisco. In my spare
									time, I enjoy staying active (I ski and swim), spending time with family and friends, and TV
									shows and movies (some of my recent favorite TV shows are: Arcane, House of the Dragon, and 
									For All Mankind; some of my favorite movies are: Interstellar, Moneyball, and Everything
									Everywhere.)

									<p>
										I graduated from UC Berkeley with a degree in Cognitive Science, 
										where I studied topics such as computer science, linguistics, 
										neuroscience and philosophy. I found that these subjects complemented each other well,
										despite some of their outward differences. 
										<!-- <br/> -->
									</p>
									<p>
										I first became interested in data analysis when I took an 
										introductory data science course here. It was so cool to be able 
										to leverage large datasets to solve problems such as seeing whether or not a 
										U.S. state's capital punishment laws
										affected crime rates in that state. It was pretty eye-opening to see the kinds of
										previously-invisible relationships that the data (as well as statistical techniques)
										showed you.
										This course was also my first introduction to code in general (working with Python in 
										Jupyter notebooks), and Python would later become (and is still to this day) my favorite
										programming language.
									</p>

								<div style="margin-right: 20px; width: 50%;">
									<p>
										After college, I started a career as a software engineer. I enjoyed the 
										work, but after about a year, I decided to try my hand at
										being a data analyst. What attracted me to software engineering was working with
										code and being able to solve technical problems, and a part of what attracts me to 
										a career in data analytics is that I will be enjoying a lot of those same things. 
										I'm making this career change because I now believe I find more satisfaction from
										using data to answer questions and drive insight, rather than building software applications
										and systems.
									</p>
									<p>
										Since I've decided to make this change, I've finished the Google Data Analytics 
										Career Certificate course. I've learned a lot about using tools such as spreadsheets, SQL, and R,
										and also learned about topics such as data gathering and data storytelling. 
										The course also harped
										on the importance of stakeholder management and effective communication. 
										I'm happy to add all these things to my skillset.	
									</p>
									<p>
										I'm excited for what the future holds and can't wait to dive in.
