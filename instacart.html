								<b> Backstory </b>
								<div style="margin-top: 15px;">
									Have you ever walked the aisles of a Target, or Safeway, or your grocery store of choice, and
									wondered which products were in other people's shopping carts? 
								</div>

								<div style="margin-top: 20px;">

									<i> What're they making for dinner tonight? What's a popular brand of salsa? Which crackers pair well with this spread? </i>

								</div>

								<div style="margin-top: 20px;">

									Hopefully, that's not just me. It's even more interesting when we can do this at scale: to see the 
									trends that can be extrapolated from aggregating tons of data on people's individual choices and habits.
									Come along with me as I take a peek into the shopping carts of a few hundred thousand people.

								</div>

								<div style="margin-top: 20px;"> <b> The Data </b> </div>

								<div style="margin-top: 20px;">

									We will be analyzing a dataset containing 3 million orders from 200,000 Instacart 
									users. These orders were anonymized and the data include things like the products within these orders, 
									the aisles and departments these items are found in, and the days and times that these orders were completed.

								</div>


								<div style="margin-top: 20px;"> <b> Key Questions </b> </div>

								<div style="margin-top: 20px;">
									Some key questions I will answer:
									<ol>
										<li> Which items are the most popular? What are some ways we can measure this?</li>
										<li> Are there sections of the store that are most popular? </li>
										<li> Is there a day and a time of day that are most popular for shopping? </li>

									</ol>

									We'll use Python, Pandas, NumPy, and other libraries to help tackle these questions and more.

								</div>

							<div style="width: 40%;"> 
								<b> Most Ordered </b>
								<div style="margin-top: 15px;">
									After our library imports, file read-ins, and initial peek at our data, one of the first things we want
									to take a look at is:
									which products were the most ordered? 
								</div>
								<div style="margin-top: 20px;">
									In the chart to the right,
									produce seems to be very popular: bananas, strawberries, spinach, avocados, and lemons are all
									among the top 10 most ordered products.
								</div>

						<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between;">
							<div style="width: 40%;">
								<b> Most Popular Time of Day </b>
								<div style="margin-top: 15px;">
									Next, we want to see which time of day is the most popular for users to place
									their orders.
								</div>
								<div style="margin-top: 20px;"> 
									In the chart to the right, we see that the most popular times are between 9am and 4pm.
								</div>

							</div>
							<div style="width: 60%;">
								<img class="image fit" src="images/project2/orders-time-day.png" />
							</div>
						</div>

						<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between;">
							<div style="width: 40%;">
								<b> Most Popular Interval For Reordering </b>

								<div style="margin-top: 15px;">
									We were also curious about users' reorders of the same products, specifically: what were the most
									common intervals of time between an order and a reorder of that same product by a given
									user?
								</div>

								<div style="margin-top: 20px;">
									In the chart to the right, we see that the most common interval is 1 month, followed by 1 week
									(30 days and 7 days respectively.)

								</div>

								<b> Best-selling Aisles </b>

								<div style="margin-top: 15px;">
									Finally, we want to see which aisles were the best-selling
									in terms of user orders.

								</div>

								<div style="margin-top: 20px;">
									In the chart to the right, we see that both fresh and packaged fruits and vegetables,
									yogurt, cheese, and sparkling water are among our best-selling aisles.
								</div>
							</div>
							<div style="width: 55%;">

							</div>

						<div>
							<b> Conclusion </b>

							<div style="margin-top: 15px;">
								Okay, so we saw some of our most pressing questions answered. People sure like their fruits and
								veggies, and they also like to put their Instacart orders in while they're at work.
				
							</div>
							<div style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 24px;">
								I answered many more questions similar to these, so click <b><a
